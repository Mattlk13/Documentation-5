# Intro

[learned about conductors in part 1, and resistors in part 4]

[semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics.]

[semiconductors have an electrical conductivity somewhere between conductors and insulators, but unlike metal conductors, their resistance decreases as their temperature increases]

[by adding impurities, a process known as _doping_, the way they conduct electricity changes, as we'll explore.]

[today, silicon is the most common semiconductor material, but [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium) and various compounds of [gallium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium) are also used.] [During the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based on germanium]

[transistors are possible via semiconductors. billions of them in a modern cpu, and millions of them in a modern Microcontroller]

[in this chapter, we'll cover how semiconductors work, and explore a number of components that utilize the physical properties of semiconductance to do interesting things, including:]

* Diodes (including LEDs)
* Transistors
* MOSFETs
