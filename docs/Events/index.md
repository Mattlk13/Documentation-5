## June

We're kicking off our Hardware Hackers roadshow in June! Join us in Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC, San Francisco, and more as we launch our new meetup groups dedicated to hacking hardware with C# and .NET!

#### Hacking Appliances and Prototyping Connected things with Netduino and Xamarin.

The hardware revolution is just beginning. Nest, Ring, Mellow; these are just the tip of the iceberg. Advances in hardware and software have opened a new world of connected possibilities that extends beyond just the consumer and into the industrial and commercial IoT world. And if you can develop apps, you can build hardware!

Come and get inspired to build your own connected things as Wilderness Labs CEO, Bryan Costanich, walks through hacking household appliances into connected things that you can control with your phone using Netduino and Xamarin. Come learn how [Netudino.Foundation](http://Netduino.Foundation) makes creating connected things in C# a piece of cake, with a massive library of peripheral drivers for sensors, LCDs, etc., and a handrolled API that makes building smart hardware a plug and play experience.
